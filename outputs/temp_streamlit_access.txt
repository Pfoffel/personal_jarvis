Possibilities to access the Streamlit app from your phone:
1. Streamlit Sharing (Streamlit Community Cloud):


   * Simplest Option: This is the easiest way to deploy and share your Streamlit app. Streamlit provides a free hosting service for Streamlit apps.
   * Process:
      * Upload your Streamlit app (jarvis_chat.py) to a public GitHub repository.
      * Create a Streamlit Community Cloud account (if you don't already have one).
      * Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud.
      * Streamlit Cloud will automatically deploy your app, and you'll get a shareable URL that you can access from any device.
   * Pros: Easiest setup, free for public repositories.
   * Cons: Requires a public GitHub repository (unless you have a paid Streamlit Cloud account).


2. Deploy to a Cloud Platform (Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure):


   * More Control: These platforms offer more control over your app's deployment and scaling.
   * Process:
      * Create an account on your chosen cloud platform.
      * Configure your app for deployment (usually involves creating a requirements.txt file listing your app's dependencies and a Procfile for Heroku).
      * Use the platform's command-line tools or web interface to deploy your app.
   * Pros: More control, scalable, can handle more traffic.
   * Cons: More complex setup, may incur costs depending on usage.


3. Port Forwarding (Advanced):


   * Technical: This method involves configuring your router to forward traffic from a specific port on your public IP address to your local machine's IP address and the port your Streamlit app is running on.
   * Process:
      * Find your public IP address.
      * Configure port forwarding on your router (the exact steps vary depending on your router model).
      * Run your Streamlit app on your local machine.
      * Access the app from your phone using your public IP address and the forwarded port.
   * Pros: No need for cloud services.
   * Cons: Requires technical knowledge, potential security risks, your local machine needs to be running.


4. Reverse Proxy (Advanced):


   * Technical: Set up a reverse proxy server (like Nginx or Apache) on a machine with a public IP address. The reverse proxy forwards requests to your Streamlit app running on your local machine.
   * Pros: More control, can add security features.
   * Cons: Requires technical knowledge, more complex setup.
