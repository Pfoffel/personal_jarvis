## Quarterly Review Preparation To-Do

Follow these steps to prepare for your quarterly review and provide me with the necessary information.

**I. Notion Access**

*   **Task:** Grant me access to your "Notes and Ideas" page in Notion.
    *   **Instructions:** Share the page with me (Jarvis) so I can access the content and incorporate it into the review.
    *   **Note:** This will allow me to extract relevant ideas, insights, and notes from your Notion workspace.

**II. Goal Overview & Metrics**

*   **Task:** Provide a clear overview of your goals for the quarter and the extent to which you achieved them.
    *   **Instructions:** For each goal, specify:
        *   The goal statement (e.g., "Learn AI through projects, agents, and apps").
        *   The specific metrics you used to measure progress (e.g., "Complete 50 AI courses/articles," "Build 3 AI agents").
        *   The actual results achieved (e.g., "Completed 35 AI courses/articles," "Built 1 AI agent").
        *   Any challenges or obstacles encountered.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Goal:** Learn AI through projects, agents, and apps
        *   **Metrics:**
            *   Complete 50 AI courses/articles
            *   Build 3 AI agents
        *   **Results:**
            *   Completed 35 AI courses/articles
            *   Built 1 AI agent
        *   **Challenges:** Time constraints, difficulty finding relevant resources.

**III. Template Instructions**

*   **Task:** Review the Quarterly Review Template and provide clear instructions for me to fill it in.
    *   **Instructions:** For each section of the template, specify:
        *   The data sources I should use (e.g., Notion journal entries, weekly reflection reports, goal overview).
        *   Any specific keywords or search terms I should use to extract relevant information.
        *   Any calculations or analysis I should perform.
        *   Any assumptions or guidelines I should follow.
        *   Any sections that require your direct input or reflection.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Section:** II. Goal Review
        *   **Instructions:**
            *   Use the goal overview you provided in Section II.
            *   Search Notion journal entries for mentions of each goal and related activities.
            *   Calculate the percentage of completion for each metric.
            *   Note any challenges or obstacles encountered.
            *   Indicate which sections require your input (e.g., self-assessment, alignment).

**IV. Provide the Quarter:**

*   **Task**: Specify the quarter and year for the review (e.g., Q2 2025).

By completing these steps, you will provide me with the necessary information and instructions to generate a comprehensive and insightful quarterly review for you. Let me know if you have any questions!
