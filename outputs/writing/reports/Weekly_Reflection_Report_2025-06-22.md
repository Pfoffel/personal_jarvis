Weekly Reflection Report: June 16, 2025 - June 22, 2025

**Reflection Questions:**

*   **What were the main accomplishments of the week?**
This week, I made significant progress on several work projects. I finished the main features of the Admin panel for the energy consumption AI, made progress on the voice conversational AI, and found a solution for providing clients with a demo. I also fixed the survey page pop-up for Daily Bites and made the photo upload feature work. I started editing my first vlog and began working on a blog post about documenting life. On a personal level, I had a very insightful conversation with Cyprien and felt very happy about Mat's support after our discussion.

*   **What were the main challenges or obstacles?**
I felt overwhelmed by the number of projects and the pressure to deliver quickly. I also had a difficult conversation with Mat, where I felt misunderstood and unsupported. Finding a proper chat history implementation for the consumption AI was also challenging.

*   **What did I learn this week?**
I learned the importance of managing my workload and prioritizing tasks. I also learned the value of open communication and support in my relationship. I gained a better understanding of how to implement chat history in chatbot applications.

*   **How well did I stick to my goals?**
I made good progress on my Work Main Quest of understanding and building AI Agents. I also made progress on my Work Side Quest of getting the Daily Bites app MVP into the Play Store. However, I did not make much progress on my Life Main Quest of picking up calisthenics again. I did make some progress on my side quest of website updates by starting a new blog post.

*   **What could I have done better?**
I could have managed my time more effectively and avoided feeling overwhelmed. I could have communicated more openly with Mat earlier in the week. I could have dedicated more time to my calisthenics goals.

*   **What am I grateful for?**
I am grateful for the progress I made on my work projects, the support I received from Mat, and the insightful conversation I had with Cyprien. I am also grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow.

*   **What are the main priorities for next week?**
My main priorities for next week are to continue working on the energy consumption AI and the voice conversational AI, to make progress on my Life Main Quest of picking up calisthenics again, and to launch the blog post.

**Personalized Feedback:**

*   **Summary of Reflections:**
This week was a mix of significant progress on work projects and some emotional challenges in my personal life. I achieved several key milestones in my AI projects and Daily Bites, but also felt overwhelmed by the workload and had a difficult conversation with Mat.

*   **Recurring Themes:**
A recurring theme is the feeling of being overwhelmed by the number of projects and the pressure to deliver quickly. Another theme is the importance of communication and support in my relationship with Mat.

*   **Suggestions for Improvement:**
To address the feeling of being overwhelmed, I should focus on prioritizing tasks and delegating when possible. I should also set realistic deadlines and break down large projects into smaller, more manageable steps. To improve my relationship with Mat, I should communicate more openly about my feelings and needs, and find ways to support each other better.

*   **Progress Tracking:**
I made good progress toward my Work Main Quest of understanding and building AI Agents, particularly with the energy consumption AI and the voice conversational AI. I also made progress on my Work Side Quest of getting the Daily Bites app MVP into the Play Store. However, I did not make much progress on my Life Main Quest of picking up calisthenics again.

*   **Alignment with Q2 Goals:**
My work on the AI projects and Daily Bites aligns well with my Work Main Quest and Side Quests. However, my lack of progress on calisthenics suggests that I need to prioritize this goal more in the coming weeks. I should also ensure that I am allocating enough time for my Life Side Quests, such as moto trips and paying debts.

*   **Work-Life Balance:**
This week, my work-life balance was not ideal. I spent a lot of time working and did not dedicate enough time to my personal life, particularly my calisthenics goals. I should prioritize rest, relationships, and personal well-being in the coming week.

*   **Relationship:**
This week, my relationship with Mat had some challenges. We had a difficult conversation where I felt misunderstood and unsupported. I should focus on improving communication, support, and connection in the coming week.

*   **Spontaneity:**
This week, my routine was quite structured and planned. I should try to incorporate more spontaneous activities into my routine to break free from rigid planning.

*   **Vlogging:**
I made a good start on my vlogging endeavors by starting to edit my first video. I should continue to work on this and aim to upload it soon. Keep up the good work!

*   **Climbing/Calisthenics:**
I did not make much progress on my calisthenics goals this week. I should prioritize this goal more in the coming weeks and find ways to align my physical activities more closely with my calisthenics goals. Perhaps incorporating climbing exercises that build strength applicable to calisthenics could be a good approach.

*   **Curiosity:**
I continued to explore my curiosity by researching and learning about AI and chatbot applications. I should continue to explore my curiosity and share my insights with others.
