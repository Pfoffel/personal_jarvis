# Q2 2025 Quarterly Review

## I. Goal Progress Assessment

### Life Main Quest: Get better at calisthenics again

*   **Initial Goal:** Achieve a 1.5 min handstand, 10 solo handstand push-ups, and a solid straddle planch (3-5 sec).
*   **Outcome:**
    *   Handstand: 1/1.5 min
    *   Handstand Push-ups: 4/10
    *   Straddle Planch: 1s
*   **Progress:** I made progress in all areas, but I didn't fully achieve the initial goals. As I journaled on April 25th, "Since my goal is to get better again at Calisthenics, I need to regain the forearm and wrist strength I had before! This Workout routine should make sure that I consistently improve my strength to not only be stronger, but also more stable and injury free." This shows my commitment to not just achieving the skills, but also building a solid foundation for long-term progress. While I didn't hit all the numbers, I'm proud of the consistent effort I put in.
*   **Positive Deviations:**
    *   I successfully trained for 3 hours per week (36 hours total), showing dedication to the process.
    *   I implemented a 15-20 minute stretch routine, which helped fix my shoulder pain. As noted on April 25th, "I created a stretch routine and made an automation on the phone so it opens that routine in notion when I get reminded by TickTick! Super cool, there is so much more now in the routines settings. I will have to play around with it again!" This highlights my proactive approach to addressing challenges and optimizing my training. This was a game-changer for my shoulder health and allowed me to train more consistently.
    *   I worked on wrist, forearm, and shoulder stability and strength, which are crucial for preventing injuries and building a solid foundation.
*   **Assessment:** While the initial metrics weren't fully met, the positive deviations indicate a strong commitment to the process and valuable adjustments to the training approach. It's worth noting that I'm also doing climbing, which, while enjoyable, isn't directly aligned with my specific calisthenics goals (handstands, planches, handstand pushups). I need to be mindful of this and ensure I dedicate enough time to targeted calisthenics training.

### Work Main Quest: Learn more about AI Systems and how to build and implement them yourself

*   **Initial Goal:** Understand and build AI Agents, finish 50 courses/webinars/articles/videos about AI Agents, and implement learnings into 10 small projects.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   Clear understanding of AI systems.
    *   Consumed over 50 kinds of media.
    *   Completed 2 small projects and 5 bigger projects.
*   **Progress:** I successfully achieved the learning goal and exceeded the project implementation goal. As I mentioned on April 23rd, "I think I am understanding now bit by bit how this all works. How to create a proper tool, how to create the agent, how to define their inputs and outputs and especially important how the whole thing flows all together." This demonstrates my growing confidence and understanding of AI agent development. The sheer volume of content I consumed is a testament to my dedication to mastering this field.
*   **Positive Deviations:**
    *   Focused on larger, more complex projects, demonstrating a deeper understanding of AI systems. This wasn't part of the original plan, but it allowed me to apply my knowledge in a more meaningful way.
*   **Assessment:** I successfully learned about AI systems and implemented that knowledge into several projects, demonstrating a strong grasp of the subject matter. The shift towards larger projects indicates a positive change in scope, leading to more significant outcomes. The highlight was definitely the Conversational AI for Onboarding, which I'm incredibly proud of.

## II. Additional Achievements

*   **Personal Growth:** I've been actively working on improving my communication skills, particularly in expressing my needs and feelings to Mat. This is an ongoing process, but I'm committed to making progress.
*   **Financial Management:** I've been diligently tracking my budget and making progress on paying off debts. This has given me a greater sense of control and security.
*   **Website Development:** I've consistently posted new content and sent out monthly newsletters, building my online presence and sharing my knowledge with others.

## III. Side Quest Assessment

### Life: Moto Discovery

*   **Goal:** Go on a couple of road trips with the moto.
*   **Outcome:** I went on one big trip with other cyclists.
*   **Assessment:** Partially achieved. Limited by time and weather. As I mentioned on May 31st, "I went to clean my moto because I will have my first trip tomorrow with a bunch of people and yeah, wanted it to perform well of course, so I also checked all the important things." Despite the limitations, I made an effort to enjoy the open road and connect with other moto enthusiasts.

### Life: Work on Relationships

*   **Goal:** Actively connect with people and create special moments.
*   **Outcome:** I improved connections with family, friends, and partner.
*   **Assessment:** Successfully achieved. I actively worked on strengthening relationships and creating a better work-life balance. As I journaled on April 19th, "We even had some really cool conversations about all this AI stuff and Trump fucking our lives, etc. But yeah super cool! I really think having talked to her made everything between us really good again!" This shows the importance I place on open communication and shared experiences.

### Work: Work on the Website

*   **Goal:** Consistently post every 2 weeks and publish a newsletter per month.
*   **Outcome:** I consistently posted and published a newsletter each month.
*   **Assessment:** Successfully achieved. I maintained consistency in website updates and newsletter publications.

### Work: Publish Daily Bites

*   **Goal:** Finish and fix all necessary features for Daily Bites to be good enough to be published.
*   **Outcome:** I made significant progress, with only one major feature missing.
*   **Assessment:** Partially achieved. I made substantial progress on Daily Bites, with only minor adjustments needed.
