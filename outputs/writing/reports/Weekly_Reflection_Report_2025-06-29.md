**Reflection Questions & Answers:**

*   **What were the main accomplishments of the week?**

    This week, I accomplished quite a bit! I successfully launched the "Train AI" project, which involved setting up a server, connecting it to a domain, and creating an SSL certificate. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm proud of how it turned out. I also bought a MacBook Pro M4, which has significantly improved my workflow and overall quality of life. Finally, I had an amazing time in London with my best friends, attending a Linkin Park concert and exploring the city.
*   **What were the main challenges or obstacles?**

    The main challenges I faced this week were related to the Monday API, which caused disruptions in my workflow and required some troubleshooting. I also encountered some initial difficulties in connecting the domain to the "Train AI" app, but I was able to overcome them through perseverance and problem-solving.
*   **What did I learn this week?**

    This week, I learned a lot about setting up servers, connecting them to domains, and creating SSL certificates. It was a completely new area for me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of perseverance and problem-solving, as well as the value of downtime and the support of my team and friends.
*   **How well did I stick to my goals?**

    I made significant progress towards my work-related goal of learning AI through projects, agents, and apps. The "Train AI" project was a major step in that direction. However, I didn't make as much progress on my life-related goal of regaining calisthenics skills. I did go climbing, but that's not directly aligned with my specific goals of handstands, planches, and handstand pushups. I need to prioritize those exercises more in the coming week.
*   **What could I have done better?**

    I could have managed my time more effectively to ensure that I made progress on both my work and life goals. I also could have been more proactive in addressing the issues with the Monday API, rather than waiting for them to become major disruptions.
*   **What am I grateful for?**

    I am grateful for the opportunity to work on challenging and rewarding projects, for the support of my team and friends, and for the ability to travel and experience new things. I am also grateful for Mat's support and for the simple things in life, like a refreshing dip in the pool and a delicious dinner.
*   **What are the main priorities for next week?**

    My main priorities for next week are to continue working on the Daily Bites app, specifically generating AI insights based on user data. I also want to address the remaining issues with Aoife's automation and potentially restart the PM Agent project with a better understanding of the underlying logic. Finally, I need to prioritize calisthenics training to make progress on my life-related goal.
