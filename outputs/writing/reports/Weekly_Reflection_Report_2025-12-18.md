**Personalized Feedback:**

*   **Summary of Reflections:** This week was a mix of overcoming technical challenges, presenting your work, and making progress on personal projects. You demonstrated resilience in tackling difficult tasks and a willingness to learn from others.
*   **Recurring Themes:** A recurring theme is your dedication to learning and improving your skills, particularly in coding and project management. You also prioritize your relationships and well-being, as evidenced by spending time with Mat and addressing Roma's health concerns.
*   **Suggestions for Improvement:** Consider breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Also, prioritize tasks based on their impact on your Q2 goals to ensure you're making progress on what matters most.
*   **Progress Tracking:** You made significant progress on your "Work" goal of learning AI through projects by working on the PM tool and Daily Bites. Remember that you committed to taking 50 courses/articles and putting your learnings into practice. Ensure you're tracking your progress on this commitment and dedicating enough time to learning and coding each week. You also took steps towards your "Life" goal of regaining calisthenics skills by going climbing, but remember to incorporate specific calisthenics training sessions into your routine to make more direct progress on your goals of achieving a 1.5-minute handstand, 10 handstand pushups, and a solid straddle planche.
*   **Alignment with Q2 Goals:** Your work on the PM tool and Daily Bites directly aligns with your "Work" goal of learning AI through projects. Climbing contributes to your "Life" goal of regaining calisthenics skills. Consider scheduling dedicated time for website updates, diet journal app launch, motorcycle trips, and relationship building to ensure you're making progress on all your side quests. Make sure you're following through on your identified action items, such as using a Notion board to track content, learnings, and action steps, and writing down a routine and initial values, as they're crucial for staying organized and making consistent progress.
