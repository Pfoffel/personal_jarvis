**Reflection Questions:**

*   **What went right this week?** I made significant progress on the PM Agent, especially with the help of Gemini Pro. I also created a manual for the newsletter setup for Jarvis and made progress on Jarvis's UI. I had a successful climbing session and a recharging day on the slackline. I also managed to create a first draft of the carbon footprint estimation app.
*   **What went wrong this week?** I struggled with the reliability of the PM Agent and encountered issues with the container setup. I also felt conditioned by my partner's jealousy when hanging out with friends. I also realized that I am letting myself down on ticktick.
*   **What can I improve next week to make it work better?** I need to focus on making the PM Agent more reliable and resolving the container setup issues. I should also work on communicating openly with my partner about my social interactions and address her concerns. I should also focus more on taking time to learn more in depth what the new technologies are, what they can achieve and what I can make out of them. That way I can come up with a clear idea in my head. If I don’t understand my toolkit, I don’t know what I can craft.

**Personalized Feedback:**

*   **Summary of Reflections:** This week was marked by significant progress in AI-related projects, particularly with the PM Agent and Jarvis's UI. You also explored new tools like Gemini Pro and Jules from Google, which greatly enhanced your workflow. Challenges included the reliability of the PM Agent and relationship dynamics.
*   **Recurring Themes:** A recurring theme is the significant impact of new AI tools (Gemini Pro, Jules) on your productivity and problem-solving abilities. Another theme is the ongoing effort to balance work, personal life, and relationship dynamics.
*   **Suggestions for Improvement:** Focus on solidifying the PM Agent's reliability and addressing the container setup issues. Continue exploring and integrating new AI tools into your workflow. Prioritize open communication with your partner to address relationship concerns.
*   **Progress Tracking:** You are making excellent progress on your Work Main Quest of understanding and building AI Agents. You are also making progress on your Life Main Quest of regaining calisthenics skills, although the initial goals may have been too ambitious.
*   **Alignment with Q2 Goals:** Your work on the PM Agent, Jarvis's UI, and the carbon footprint estimation app aligns well with your Work Main Quest. Your climbing and slacklining activities contribute to your Life Side Quest of adventure and excitement, but are not directly aligned with your specific calisthenics goals (handstands, planches, handstand pushups).
