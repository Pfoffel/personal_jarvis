## Instruction Manual: Generating "The Journey" Newsletter

**1. Purpose**

This manual outlines the process for generating "The Journey" newsletter each month, summarizing your activities, insights, and goals from your Notion journaling entries.

**2. Frequency**

Generate the newsletter at the end of each month, focusing on the events of the most recently completed month.

**3. Tools Required**

*   Notion API access (already configured)
*   Access to "The Journey" newsletter template (structure outlined below)

**4. Process**

**Step 1: Determine the Target Month**

*   Use the `get_date` tool to get the current date.
*   **Logic for Determining Target Month:**
    *   If the current day of the month is less than or equal to 25, the target month is the previous month.
    *   If the current day of the month is greater than 25, the target month is the current month.
*   Calculate the target month and year based on this logic. For example:
    *   If the current date is May 20, 2025, the target month is April 2025.
    *   If the current date is May 27, 2025, the target month is May 2025.

**Step 2: Retrieve Notion Journal Entries**

*   Use the `get_notion_journaling_month` tool to retrieve all journal entries for the target month.
*   Specify the `selected_month` and `selected_year` parameters.

**Step 3: Retrieve and Reference the Most Recent Newsletter**

*   To ensure each newsletter provides fresh and unique content, it's crucial to reference the most recent edition.
*   Use the `list_google_drive_files_and_folders` tool to find the most recent newsletter in the "Jarvis Content > writing > newsletters" folder in Google Drive. This tool requires no specific parameters but will list all files and folders in the specified directory.
*   Use the `export_google_drive_workspace_document` tool to export the content of the most recent newsletter as a text file. This tool requires the `file_id` of the newsletter you want to export and the `export_mime_type` which should be set to `"text/plain"`. You also need to specify a `local_save_path` where the exported file will be saved.
*   Use the `load_file_content` tool to load the content of the exported file. This tool requires the `path` to the local file you just saved.
*   Carefully review the content of the most recent newsletter to avoid repetition and build upon previous insights. Pay close attention to the key events, wins, challenges, lessons, and resources that were already highlighted.
*   Additionally, use the review to identify any "Looking Ahead" sections where you discussed upcoming plans for the next month. Include updates on those points in the new newsletter, providing readers with a follow-up on promised developments.

**Step 4: Extract Relevant Information**

*   Analyze the retrieved journal entries, focusing on the following sections:
    *   Primary Tasks
    *   Secondary Tasks
    *   Journal
    *   Notes/Ideas
*   Identify key events, wins, challenges, lessons, and insights from these sections.
*   Reference the most recent newsletter to avoid repetition and build upon previous insights.

**Step 5: Populate the Newsletter Template**

*   Use the extracted information to fill in the sections of "The Journey" newsletter template, following the structure outlined below.

**Step 6: Save the Draft Newsletter**

*   Use the `save_output` tool to save the generated newsletter as a `.md` file in the `writing` category, with a descriptive file name (e.g., `TheJourneyNewsletterApril2025.md`).
*   Use the `upload_file_to_google_drive` tool to upload the generated newsletter as a Google Docs document to the "Jarvis Content > writing > newsletters" folder. Set `convert_to_google_doc` to True. Ensure the file_name parameter does not include the file extension and replaces underscores with spaces (e.g., "The Journey Newsletter April 2025" instead of "The\_Journey\_Newsletter\_April\_2025.md").

**Step 7: Review and Refine**

*   Inform you that the draft newsletter is ready for review.
*   Provide the file path so you can easily access it.

**Step 8: Delete Local Files**

*   To maintain a clean and organized file system, use the `delete_local_file` tool to delete any local files that were downloaded during this process, such as the exported content of the previous newsletter. This tool requires the `file_path` of the file to be deleted.

**7. Example Implementation**

Let's say it's May 20, 2025, and you want to generate the newsletter. Because the day is less than or equal to 25, I would generate the newsletter for April 2025. If it were May 27, 2025, I would generate the newsletter for May 2025.
