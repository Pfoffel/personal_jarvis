# Instruction Manual: Generating "The Journey" Newsletter

---

## 1. Purpose

This manual outlines the process for generating "The Journey" newsletter each month, summarizing your activities, insights, and goals from your Notion journaling entries.

---

## 2. Frequency

Generate the newsletter at the end of each month, focusing on the events of the most recently completed month.

---

## 3. Tools Required

* Notion API access (already configured)
* Access to "The Journey" newsletter template (structure outlined below)

---

## 4. Process

### Step 1: Determine the Target Month

* Use the `get_date` tool to get the current date.
* **Logic for Determining Target Month:**
    * If the current day of the month is less than or equal to 25, the target month is the previous month.
    * If the current day of the month is greater than 25, the target month is the current month.
* Calculate the target month and year based on this logic. For example:
    * If the current date is May 20, 2025, the target month is April 2025.
    * If the current date is May 27, 2025, the target month is May 2025.

### Step 2: Retrieve Notion Journal Entries

* Use the `get_notion_journaling_month` tool to retrieve all journal entries for the target month.
* Specify the `selected_month` and `selected_year` parameters.

### Step 3: Retrieve the Most Recent Newsletter

* Use the `list_google_drive_files_and_folders` tool to find the most recent newsletter in the "Jarvis Content > writing > newsletters" folder in Google Drive.
* Use the `export_google_drive_workspace_document` tool to export the content of the most recent newsletter as a text file, then use the `load_file_content` tool to load the content of the exported file.

### Step 4: Extract Relevant Information

* Analyze the retrieved journal entries, focusing on the following sections:
    * Primary Tasks
    * Secondary Tasks
    * Journal
    * Notes/Ideas
* Identify key events, wins, challenges, lessons, and insights from these sections.
* Reference the most recent newsletter to avoid repetition and build upon previous insights.

### Step 5: Populate the Newsletter Template

* Use the extracted information to fill in the sections of "The Journey" newsletter template, following the structure outlined below.

### Step 6: Save the Draft Newsletter

* Use the `save_output` tool to save the generated newsletter as a `.md` file in the `writing` category, with a descriptive file name (e.g., `TheJourneyNewsletterApril2025.md`).
* Use the `upload_file_to_google_drive` tool to upload the generated newsletter as a Google Docs document to the "Jarvis Content > writing > newsletters" folder. Set `convert_to_google_doc` to `True`. Ensure the `file_name` parameter does not include the file extension and replaces underscores with spaces (e.g., "The Journey Newsletter April 2025" instead of "The_Journey_Newsletter_April_2025.md").

### Step 7: Review and Refine

* Inform you that the draft newsletter is ready for review.
* Provide the file path so you can easily access it.

## Example Implementation

Let's say it's May 20, 2025, and you want to generate the newsletter. Because the day is less than or equal to 25, I would generate the newsletter for April 2025. If it were May 27, 2025, I would generate it for May 2025.
