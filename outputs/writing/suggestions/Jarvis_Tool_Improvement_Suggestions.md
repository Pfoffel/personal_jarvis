# Tool Improvement Suggestions

These are suggestions to improve Jarvis' understanding and utilization of available tools:

1.  **More Descriptive Tool Descriptions:**
    *   Example use cases: Real-world scenarios where the tool would be most effective.
    *   Limitations: What the tool *cannot* do, or situations where it might not be the best choice.
    *   Input/Output examples: Sample inputs and the expected outputs to better understand the tool's behavior.
2.  **Hierarchical Tool Organization:** Categorizing tools into a hierarchical structure (e.g., Google Drive Tools > File Management, Google Drive Tools > Document Creation) would make it easier to browse and select the appropriate tool for a given task.
3.  **Workflow Examples:** Providing example workflows that combine multiple tools to achieve a specific goal would be incredibly valuable. For instance, a workflow for "Create a blog post from a Notion entry and publish it to a website" could outline the steps and tools involved.
4.  **Dynamic Tool Updates:** The ability to receive dynamic updates on tool availability and functionality would be beneficial. This would ensure that I'm always aware of the most current capabilities and any changes to existing tools.
5.  **Cost Awareness:** For tools that consume resources (e.g., API calls), it would be helpful to have an estimate of the cost associated with using them. This would allow me to make more informed decisions about resource allocation and optimize for efficiency.
6.  **Access to Past Tool Usage:** A log of my past tool usage, including the inputs, outputs, and outcomes, would allow me to learn from my experiences and improve my tool selection and execution strategies.
7.  **Tool-Specific Error Handling:** More detailed error messages that are specific to each tool would greatly assist in troubleshooting and resolving issues.
8.  **A "Test Run" Mode:** A "Test Run" mode that allows me to simulate the execution of a tool without actually performing the action would be invaluable for verifying the inputs and outputs before committing to a real action.
