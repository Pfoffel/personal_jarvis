Hey there buddy! Of course, I can help with that! To get your journaling notes from yesterday, I need to first get the current date so I can figure out what yesterday was. After that, I'll need to grab the environment variables to access your Notion database. Then I can use the `get_notion_journaling_month` to retrieve the notes. Let's do it step by step!

Sure thing! To retrieve your journaling notes from yesterday, April 30th 2025, I'll need to access your Notion database. For this I will need to use the `get_notion_journaling_month` tool and specify the month and year.

Would you like me to proceed with retrieving your notes from April 2025?


yes

Good thing is, I got surprisingly far with it. That far that I would actually say, that the only thing missing is the tools for the last Agent. Though I think it might be better to feed the individual tasks one by one to another tool LLM instead of running all at once. It seems to do it quite well, but on a real project I think I would be too scared to lose control.\nNow we have the rest of the day free, which is great! This means I have enough time to do everything I wanted, especially since we have bad weather.\nLater on I worked on the PM tool which also is basically done, the only thing missing is to adapt the way it fetches the raw data, as Alberto made me a new table that has more information. This means I spent today stripping down a bit of code thanks to the more efficient table that allows me to call less queries. Nonetheless it was a lot to look into as even stripping back is like adding new code since you have to change the logic again. But very fun and helpful!\nThen I took Mat to her physio, went for a little grocery shopping tour and made the dinner.\nNow I‚Äôll try to finish the basic retrieval of the notion pages.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nA lot of success on the PM Agent\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1e4cbfc5-adbc-8010-86a2-e7552fcc777c", "title": "Tuesday - April 29, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nTest concept for the PM Agent\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nTest notion API\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was good!\nMat was working from home with me today, which was great!\nToday was the day when I managed to get firstly the PM tool fully working in this first version stage. Secondly, a few tests on how the PM Agent could be working.\nI think I am understanding now bit by bit how this all works. How to create a proper tool, how to create the agent, how to define their inputs and outputs and especially important how the whole thing flows all together. \nIt was amazing when the first test actually worked and to my surprised it worked right away as I intended it to. I really felt amazed by it and how it autonomously fills in the data you usually would have had to fill in yourself. Super cool! Pydantic is an amazing help for this whole process, it makes it so much easier!\nThen after a great day at work, I jumped into figuring out how to use the Notion API. So far, this has been incredibly complicated. I feel like the dict I get, is so complicated and intertwined that it makes the retrieval of the actual thing you want super complex. But anyway, it‚Äôs a one time set up that then should work for all future scenarios.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI got an amazing test run completed for the PM Agent\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1e3cbfc5-adbc-807c-b92b-dc9d766625c6", "title": "Monday - April 28, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nGet a basic structure into the AI Agent\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nLook into server plans\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was an absolute crazy day!\nI really enjoyed it though!\nSo, everything was normal in general - besides from still having issues with the stupid query for the PM tool. Oh it is driving me crazy.\nAnyway, you would never guess this:\nThere has been a power outage, not just in our apartment or maybe even the city, which is already mad - it has been in several countries in Europe! That‚Äôs absolute mad. To live such an event was for me completely surreal. I really enjoyed every moment of it.\nSo it started around 12:30, where I was still trying to finish the PM tool finally. All of the sudden everything went dark. Of course, first thing I do, is go to the thing where you toggle the main circuits of the apartment. Weird thing though, there was nothing switched off. It took me a second to realize it, but I knew then that this must have meant that at least our area was completely turned off. Bit by bit messages from everyone came in, saying it was all Madrid, that was effected, then all Spain and soon people were experiencing it all over the continent. Surreal! Of course no power means no internet and no internet meant I couldn‚Äôt do much more for work. Overwhelmed by all this, I decided to leave it be since it was almost 13:00, lunch break. I went outside with Roma and started realizing bit by bit the impact of this whole thing. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I couldn‚Äôt talk to anybody, I couldn‚Äôt text I couldn‚Äôt research, I couldn‚Äôt work properly, I couldn‚Äôt heat my food, I couldn‚Äôt watch TV, nothing that I would usually do was possible. So, I really started laughing out loud all alone on the streets, because of this situation and the realization of how dependent we have become of electricity. Also realizing that I had no clue where it actually came from and how it worked. Yes, I know how it is being generated and so on, but how does it actually flow and what cables connect in which way - no clue! So fascinating!\nAnyway, when I got back, I ate my cold noodles and started working again on what I could without researching or helping myself on the internet. I planned out the main structure of the PM Agent, which was a huge help, to actually take the time and play out the scenarios that the AI would encounter and see if the plan was making sense in theory. Sometimes pen and paper do still help. Then, around 15:30, Mat comes home. I didn‚Äôt know of course, I couldn‚Äôt communicate properly with her. She told me that the streets were completely collapsed and that she took around an hour to get here, which usually takes 15 min. Madness!\nWe laughed a bit together and exchanged how our days had passed. I honestly enjoyed it so much, I think this should happen more often. People finally being forced to talk to each other distraction free. Loved it! Then we sat on the couch, she took a tiny nap and I read a bit, since there was nothing else I could have done. Almost all my projects involve electricity or internet at least üòÜ So ridiculous. \nThen we went for another walk and I went for a workout afterwards. After that I went to the supermarket, which also had an absolute apocalypse vibe. \nSince we really didn‚Äôt have much more to do, we did two more things: I took the chance and talked Mat into brainstorming together about our future and the business we could built. I think she enjoyed it a lot. And secondly play a nice round of ‚ÄúStadt Land Fluss‚Äù after dinner. We played it with candles and pen and paper. This was so cool and so much fun!\nAll together a really fun day honestly!\nAnd just FYI, the power just came back now, almost exactly 11h later, wow!\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI lived a day in the past!\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1e2cbfc5-adbc-80e8-abf5-e613b671321e", "title": "Sunday - April 27, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nFinish the habit trackers\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nUpload my 3rd post\n**Journaling Time**:\nI really liked today!\nIt started with us going to dance in the morning, we finally picked up dance classes again. It was really fun, we laughed a lot and enjoyed it a lot!\nAfter that we didn‚Äôt do much. We chilled, then we did some house keeping stuff, cooking, cleaning, reorganizing, etc. Afterwards I spent some time finishing up the post, updating my budget tracker and that‚Äôs basically it.\nThen we watched a movie, very nice one, a pity I didn‚Äôt understand everything, as it was in French, but well, that way I learn!\nTomorrow I will get on writing the code for my monthly journaling analysis. That way I have yet another thing to include in the first newsletter!

This I will finish tomorrow and then I will have to make at least a Newsletter template which I have to send before the 1st.\nThis blog post is about AI, which made up a big portion of this month. I learned a lot, I tried a lot and through writing this, I realized I user it in all types of scenarios. I love how it can help me in so many things to make a real difference, while others just don‚Äôt take advantage of it.\nThe I also cleaned a bit, did the grocery shopping and cleared a few of the todos I had on TickTick. Quite productive I would say.\nThen I met up with my brother Alex, who was here for his dentist appointment. We spent some nice time together, but I do realized that we are just not evolving in the same direction. This makes conversations sometimes a bit forced instead of really pleasant as it was before. I feel like everything is very superficial. And then it bothers me personally a lot to see him in this circle of always finding excuses to drink or to do what ever thing that is just not beneficial. I honestly think it‚Äôs the same issue I have with Mat sometimes, that I know they are capable of more, but I see them stuck there and not caring about it. This also reminds me then always about me a few months ago and I just don‚Äôt want to remember that. I am not that person anymore!\nOtherwise is was an uneventful nice day!\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI finished the draft for the next blog post\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1e0cbfc5-adbc-8028-966c-f319f2574cea", "title": "Friday - April 25, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nImplement 15 min Stretch routine\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nMake a wrist and forearm training\n**Journaling Time**:\nHey hey!\nSo today was a bit more chill. I have done stuff, for sure, but it was not such a hustle as it usually is.\nI finished basically the whole first preview of the export app for the PMs. Now you can do everything necessary that you would need to do. I still have to wait for Alberto to get me a table with all correct mappings, fields, dropdowns etc. but in the meantime I will just use the usual default values that are hardcoded and put them there for now.\nThen I learned a lot more about langchain, react agents, implemented my first quick example of an agent (supervisor) that has access to other agents and then those have access to other tools. It was fairly simple I just have to look at how we will accomplish the big thing: \ncreate agents on demand automatically.\nThen we also got a new vacuum robot. I was very sceptic about how it would perform and how it would be able to navigate through the apartment, but it completely convinced me after setting it up. It was so well implemented, the app was amazing, the mapping was great and it is smart. I am very happy! This will be great to maintain a minimum clean level that will become a new standard.\nOther than that not much! I have also created a stretch routine and made an automation on the phone so it opens that routine in notion when I get reminded by TickTick! Super cool, there is so much more now in the routines settings. I will have to play around with it again!\nOnly thing missing would be creating a workout routine for forearm and wrist strengthening.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nWe got a new robot vacuum which is surprisingly well!\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n \nAdditional Space\nTo implement a 15 min stretch I will actually first ask AI to know what it thinks are the best steps to successfully implement a new habit into life:\nSuggestions from Chat GPT:\nFind a dedicated time in the day where you do that:\nMorning\nAfter work\nBefore bed\nAttach it to something you already do\nI assume it would be easier to couple it with somethin I already do to make sure it is easier incorporated\nI would say maybe after going out with Roma, as I take her out after work every day\nSet a reminder\nThis I can easily do with TickTick!\nKeep it easy at first\nHe suggests 5 min at first to not feel overwhelmed\nTrack your progress\nThis is already part of TickTick so not needed\nI have additionally created a routine on my phone, that then opens the streching page in notion so that I can directly use it\nüßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è \n15-Minute Full Body Stretch (Focus: Shoulders & Wrists)\nüîπ \nWarm-Up (2 min)\nNeck Rolls\n ‚Äì 30 sec each di irection\nShoulder Rolls\n ‚Äì 30 sec forward, 30 sec backward\nArm Shakes\n ‚Äì 30 sec\nüîπ \nUpper Body & Wrists (8 min)\nShoulder Stretch Across Chest\n ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec per arm)\nOverhead Triceps Stretch\n ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec per arm)\nThread the Needle\n (on all fours, rotate arm under and across) ‚Äì 1 min per side\nWrist Flexor Stretch\n (arm out, palm up, pull fingers down) ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec each)\nWrist Extensor Stretch\n (arm out, palm down, pull fingers back) ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec each)\nWall Angels\n (back against wall, sliding arms up/down) ‚Äì 1 min\nDoorway Chest Stretch\n ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec per side)\nüîπ \nLower Body & Spine (5 min)\nCat-Cow Stretch\n (on all fours) ‚Äì 1 min\nSeated Forward Fold\n ‚Äì 1 min\nKneeling Hip Flexor Stretch\n ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec per leg)\nChild‚Äôs Pose with Arms Extended Forward\n ‚Äì 1 min\nSupine Twist\n (lying down, one leg across) ‚Äì 1 min (30 sec per side)\n‚ö°Ô∏è\n5-Minute Quick Stretch (Low-Energy Days)\n‚è± Total: 5 Minutess\nHold each stretch for ~30 seconds\n1.

It is a hundred percent better. Nonetheless, I think I am just not built for them. I posture and skeleton are just not made to make sense of ergonomic chairs and helpful designs. But, I am for sure super comfortable compared to before.\nToday I spent the morning with analyzing what the generated agent from manus was doing and how it worked, to learn from it. I definitely learned a lot, but got stuck on the agent_executor, because I couldn‚Äôt understand what it actually was doing. I think it was just not correctly implemented to be honest. Maybe because of being a mix of showcasing and actual working parts, the workflow was not quite correctly set up.\nAfter that I spend some time coming up with a nice structure for a template for all coming AI projects that I could easily set up and start automatically on vs code. It was super cool, now I just type in ‚Äúnewproj‚Äù in the terminal and it gets me a new directory where I have all my template files with the name I provide it with and even adaptable, depending on what type of project I select - super cool.\nThe afternoon I spent a bit more on adding the final features for the first version of the webapp for the PMs. It is coming along very well to be honest. The main features all work now. The biggest struggle I do have is how I should incorporate the conditional and relational features that they sometimes need. You know sometimes they just need a concat column or a if this then that column that depends on the country for example, where ES would become a value and DE another. All this is quite difficult to implement I think. I will look for an example tomorrow to see if they have set up all that in a query or if that is done through the script. I‚Äôll figure it out. Otherwise I could actually ask them to still request those for the raw export, which would mean that it would than be available in the webapp as the webapp just takes the same things there are in the raw export. We will see.\nFor me the biggest thing nonetheless, was hearing that Brahim told Maria and Johann at BIG, that he was amazed and super happy by the work I had presented yesterday. Though I know now more about langchain and that it means that I haven‚Äôt actually implemented things in an efficient way, this is still great to hear form the CEO. I am super proud of myself!!!\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nBrahim talked about me in his other company, because he was super happy and impressed\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1decbfc5-adbc-80b2-a7d8-ce0815236cd8", "title": "Wednesday - April 23, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nMake it loop so it feels more like a chat bot\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was super great!\nI had a really nice day at the office, because I managed to get the webapp to the point where it could export the excel even with the applied mapping. That was such a big step, I‚Äôm so happy.\nI honestly think as well that my mind is evolving a lot as well. I see code in a more natural way after each day passes.\nThen I spend an hour or 2 on getting the final presentable version of the AI Game Agent done. Today Brahim was in the office, so I assumed he would be present for it. That of course build up some stress to begin with, but I was confident I would make it work.\nAnyway, as I was finishing up I also tried to have a little demo and a structured prepared in case I would get asked about what I had come up with.\nThe hour had come: it was 14:30 and we all gathered in the room to talk about the progress we had made. For some reason we decided that I should start with my findings and stuff that I came up with - no pressure!\nI think I presented it super well and gave everybody a good overview of the potential I have and the potential ideas that I had tried to demonstrate. Brahim was super interested and asked a lot of stuff to understand what was what, what I had done to make it work and what the process of it was. Then the others presented. I was surprised that really nobody had taken a slight effort to try and code anything themselves. I thought this was what all this was about. And still Brahim seemed very interested and happy about what they had come up with, which was just basically using a type of Chat GPT for agents and giving it a prompt. Nothing else, nothing complex, noting custom, nothing learned‚Ä¶ So I was surprised to see him enjoy this so much, I really thought I had come up with something great.\nWhen they were done with their parts, Brahim held for a min and then said, ‚ÄúSo, out of all, I prefer Henochs!‚Äù. I was completely blown away. What? He liked mine the best. What the hell was happening? It was the first meeting I have with the CEO, where I had to present something and here I was hearing that he liked mine the best!? Amazing! What a feeling!\nSo, he kept saying that this is where we have to go towards. We have to build things ourselves, of course there is nothing bad with aiding us through LLMs that generate stuff for us. But the purpose is to understand it, to then know how to do it ourselves when necessary and to tweak what ever we need to tweak for our purposes.\nAfter that I obviously asked Lukas (my new boss), about what he had presented to see what we could learn from it and not have him feel like I did something better or anything like that. It was honestly a great tool he used which also gave us access to all open source materials.

Yes I thought I was super smart and finally got it to work. But in the end, it was just luck. Especially weird though because I got two good outputs after the other, which for me was a clear sign that I had figured it out! But apparently it was just luck. Oh man. Well I will test it out now again, to see if it actually works now.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI moved a lot in the web app\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1dccbfc5-adbc-8051-868c-e1194e4604d5", "title": "Monday - April 21, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nWork on the code generation model\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was a super busy day!\nI had a lot to do and switched between a lot of different tasks.\nI would even say, I was quite efficient with all of them.\nReb/Bea needed my help with adding a few more Opt Ins and MQIs to the delivery file. So I ran my dear old AI model again to fake everything and it worked like a charm. I think within 30 min or so I had all 150 additional leads updated including updated interview questions, lead comment and suggested new status.\nIt was so much fun!\nOh right I also had to do the central report in the morning which took the first two hours of the morning‚Ä¶\nThen Of course I also kept working on the PM web app which now displays all campaign names and is able to tell which export they want to download and therefore giving me the beginning to generating the query needed for that export. This will be one of the biggest challenges for sure!\nAt last I was also working on the AI Game thing. It was quite nice until I realized that I actually didn‚Äôt get any proper results when prompting for the code generation, even though I almost always get a proper one when using it in the console. This is just super annoying and I have been trying to figure out what the issue is for hours.\nFinally, I had nice talks with Mat. Again, since we talked it works much better again between us!\nI am very proud of her!\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nWorked on a lot of nice projects!

We went groceries shopping, clean the car, clean the apartment, make lunch for work and watch a very nice and original movie: It ends with us. \nOther than that there was not much. I spent quite some time watching Flash, then I researched a few routes we could take on the moto for our first trips and then I just chilled mainly.\nI‚Äôm very excited to go to work tomorrow again! I hope it will go well and I won‚Äôt have to do the Central Report üòì\nNow I will finish to update the budget tracker, or at least quite some of it and then work a bit more on the AI thing!\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nWatching Flash :D\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1dacbfc5-adbc-80c4-8da4-e1f94d8a9562", "title": "Saturday - April 19, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nSchedule all deadlines into the calendar\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nWork on the next function for the AI Game\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was a very tiring day!\nIn the morning we said good bye to Mats family and went then back to sleep, as it was around 4 o‚Äôclock. Then we woke up at around 9 and started cleaning the house a bit, making sure we got everything and then waited for the owners to come and take the keys back.\nIn the meantime I talked to my mum, to know when we could meet. She was super upset and started crying over the phone. I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on, she didn‚Äôt want to tell me nor say good bye to me, which was quite sad. I tried to not take it personal and just move on, but in the end it is just quite hard to hear from your mum that she doesn‚Äôt wanna see you. No idea what was wrong with her honestly. Anyway, I could convince her in the end to come by and quickly say good bye. So that was good! \nThen we went to have some breakfast and off to the trip - 6 hours on the road. When we were about to leave the city we saw how a cat got run over by a car. It was absolutely horrifying to watch. The cat was doing back flips and jumping around completely wildly until it landed on the side of the road. There it looked already quite dead, but not fully. We stopped the car right next to it to see if we could take it to a vet. We called one close by and asked whether we could bring her by to see if they could save her in a way. When I crossed the street to get to the side where the cat was, she already had stopped moving. I thought maybe she was just resting and saving her energy. Unfortunately, she was already gone. It was horrible I looked into her eyes and they were just dead. What an experience. It really left me blank there. I tried to find a pulse and see if she would react to anything to see if there was still hope, but nothing. It was horrible honestly. I was so upset I couldn‚Äôt do anything.\nThe rest of the trip was quite unexciting. Too unexciting sometimes! I was so tired I think I really fell asleep for a sec. It was terrifying then to realize that I was out there for a split second. What could have happened if this was in the wrong moment? Such a crazy thought. I would have been responsible for my 2 girls getting hurt. But otherwise I survived it quite well. We even had some really cool conversations about all this AI stuff and Trump fucking our lives, etc. But yeah super cool! I really think having talked to her made everything between us really good again!\nOtherwise nothing big happened when we arrived. We were dead and didn‚Äôt do anything really.\nNow I will try and be a bit productive and plan out life a bit and continue the AI Game.

Today was the last day, which is why I‚Äôm a bit sad, but thinking positively: it was an amazing time. Especially since Mat and I have talked now, I feel very close to her again! This is how it should feel like and I‚Äôm very glad that it does.\nWe had some great dinner as well and prepped a nice surprise for the family tomorrow morning when they will wake up.\nOh and also, we showered Roma, which was easy enough, but also sad to see her not enjoy it. I would have thought that it is fun for all dogs. Well no problem - it is what it is.\nRegarding the AI Agent, I have read a bunch of things again on Langchain to prep for the next steps.

There were some annoying things like the places we found at the beginning to drink a coffee,  were just completely shit, 1.8 stars, that is ridiculous. Then we walked a bit through the streets, saw nice building, ate nice things, had a nice walk etc. Then we had some food and ice and cookies haha. It was good.\nAfter that I went to visit Manuels Family, which was great as always, they are super funny and make me feel great honestly! I love them a lot.\nThen we went back home since my mom, titin and Alberto with her girlfriend were invited to come and have dinner with us. What a crazy scenario honestly, I was so nervous and anxious that I was in a t-shirt throughout the whole night, while the others were already asking for the second jacket. Anyways, I felt maybe a bit too responsible for there well-being that I stressed about everything. I didn't want anyone to feel left out or anything so it was very hard.\nBut I think generally it was good to have this night, it turned out super super funny. My mom drank wine, ate quite a lot, was a bit melancholic but yeah over all super happy I think. I am very glad to have had my family all together. Then Mat wanted to talk to me, so of course, I was stressed out and wanted to know what that was all about. We talked a lot and got a lot of things out of our chests, which helped a lot.\nI would like to follow up on a few of them to know how we can better them, but I got finally everything off my chest.

I feel like it is not too hard to understand so it should he fine to get a basic thing up en running I think.\nAfter that we had a nice BBQ, went for some ice and took a little walk at the view point on the cliffs of the beach. It was very beautiful as always! \nAfterwards we went to Titins bar and had a really nice time there. As always he is just a great host and made us laugh a lot haha.

Then we went to see the processions in Cadiz. Very cool to watch as always. Especially with the heavy rain that hit us, it was very epic. Not as fun for ourselves though, as we were completely wet the rest of the day.\nThen we went to the Flamenco Show, which was also really really cool. It‚Äôs crazy what an energy the have while dancing this way. Very impressive. We laughed a lot, especially Mat‚Äôs dad who just behaves as a child in such things honestly, just too funny.

I had quite some arguments with Mat. Um, it is very hard to talk to her. She is always against me. She always says, I am wrong, doing things wrong. And honestly, if that would be all she does, it would be fine. But the issue is that she tells me in a way that's not nice to hear and she shouts at me and treats me badly, and that just doesn‚Äôt feel nice. Especially not from the person that you tried to do everything for and be always there for and treat as princes, and then she just treats you as the garbage that she just assumes will always be there. So it just doesn't feel good to ve treated like that and it really makes me feel bad. It also makes me turn the wheels in my head to figure out what I can do to make it work better and to communicate it to her, but every scenario in my head turns out to be my fault again‚Ä¶\nOtherwise it was quite nice, because we met up with her family now and also with my mom and Titin so that was quite cool and nice. I enjoyed that a lot. But it just really keeps me thinking in the background about what to do right now. I wanted to talk to her, but in the end it is just to complicated. Yes there is never a right time, but honestly right now when her family is here, it‚Äôs maybe not the right time.\nAnyway, I showed them finally the Ski video! In general I would have hoped for more excitement, but on the other side I also realized that they weren‚Äôt as much in the video as I thought.

And problem solving, then usually what I just is it once or 2 hours a day or even a week. But it is very, very nice. After work, I was very, very retired. So I didn't react all too well when Mathilde sent me a list, there are things to do before we go to the vacations. It was very frustrating and different. I just don't feel right now. Whoever you understood, I will try to talk to her about it today. We will see if That changes anything. Because I think she's fine. It's just way too much on her phone and not using the potential that she has within her.\nBut yeah, otherwise it was a nice day, because I got a lot of things. Done at work.

Really excited to see the end result.\nWe also had another session for the AI agents thing for Brahim.

I learned a lot about flask, how to make sense of the connections it creates with html etc. I also understand a fair bit of js now which is great!

That brought Lukas an I to an idea, that we could put my PM tool firstly as a web app, which we could than give to the PMs to really automate their deliveries through that. They would be able to create their own exports, we would take info from \nMonday.com\n directly to make it as streamlined as possible, etc. It sounds super cool and I‚Äôm super excited to keep working on it tomorrow!\nI brought Manolitos today, for the PMs. Of course they enjoyed it a lot haha. Tas asked me to choose some Disney post cards from the ones she had brought, so they could all write me something as a good bye note. I left it there with them and came back later. I was so happy to receive them, honestly such nice and heartfelt notes that they left for me. I loved reading through them so much. I missed them a lot today, it felt very weird not being there.\nIn the afternoon Lukas presented me officially to Ruben and Edu, which are my main point of contacts for all those automation hacks and tips and tricks. They both are super nice and Ruben is quite a freaky person haha. In a good way tho.\nFinally I had a nice meeting with Lukas to get to know each other and then I watched James presenting to the newbies how they should ideally fill in the CRM. What a funny and passive aggressive guy üòÇ\nAt home I took advantage of Mat being at her hair styler again to fix the color they made her on Saturday and finalized the blog post. It turned out super great. Honestly I think I can be super proud of what I have done there. It is very insightful, well written and interactive. I added a section to download a google doc file containing a template to help them set up their goals in a simpler way than with my big template. And I added a section to leave comments.

Mathilde was working today in the morning until 15:30, so I had quite some time to finish the last bits of the blog post. Or that was at least my plan. I didn‚Äôt count on having so many ideas and having so much fun adding things, that it turned out to be around 3.300 words long!!! Yes, over 3.000 words, isn‚Äôt that completely crazy? I am super proud of it. The first draft was already quite good, but of course since I had some times where the concentration dropped, you could notice it in those paragraphs as well. Good thing we live in an era where we have access to AI tools that can help immensely. Claude made ma an amazing job of polishing up my first draft. It made some paragraphs sound so much better and organized some sections to be better readable, etc. This is such a great tool to make life easier for a writer. Then he also suggested photos I could add to some sections, with detailed descriptions about how they should look like and the message they will convey. I didn‚Äôt manage to put everything into the website template, so that‚Äôs a bit disappointing, but not such a big deal either. It is true that it turned out amazingly so I think there is nothing bad with publishing it a few hours later the next day.\nSince Mat was out to work, she had the idea that I pick her up when she finished and bring Roma with as well. It was a different range than the usual one. I had never been there and if I had known how hard it was to find it and to pass the horrible holes on the road, I might have never gotten there to begin with! But in the end I made it, after loosing a few hairs about it. It was quite pretty actually you had a great view over the courses as they were build into the mountainous landscape. Very cool and very pretty!\nIt was a bit much for Roma maybe with all the animals, people and impressions, but I think it did do her well.\nThat was basically the day, I also cooked for the week for myself and prepared the next two meals for Mat, as usual, but otherwise nothing much. It was really all about finishing the blog post, which I really enjoyed. \n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI made an amazing blog post draft\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1cccbfc5-adbc-802b-aaa7-d38a8b99e88b", "title": "Saturday - April 5, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nWork on the draft for the Quests Blog Post\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nHelp Lump come up with a plan to find purpose\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday started with a very nice breakfast, done by my lovely GF Mat! It was super delicious, though it had to wait until after I brought her to her Hair appointment. And even though it was super delicious, something made me feel really bad afterwards. My stomach was going completely crazy.\nSince she was going to be there for a few hours, I took advantage and cleaned the apartment, went groceries shopping and worked on the draft for my 2nd blog post! Super excited. Right now, when writing this (23:25), I was at the stage of developing a header for it. I thought that template that Claude gave me was way to complex, but it really makes me visualize all the insights I want to bring across in that post and what the general outline and message will be. Very Happy so far!\nThen around 17:00, I went climbing with Lump, even though my shoulder, elbow and upper back was hurting today. I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore to prevent everything from hurting.\nAnyway, I went with him and it was very nice. We had a nice session just the two of us.\nYesterday he told me about how he was feeling lately, that he wasn‚Äôt happy and had no drive and no dreams. That was really sad, so today I decided to hang out with him after climbing and try to help him coming up with a plan that could give him this sensation of purpose and energy that I am feeling right now since I started this hole thing.\nIt was not easy at all, because his devotions are nothing like mine, he loves CAD, optimizing fabrication processes, wood working, 3D printing, etc. Yes, I do love those topics as well, but I don‚Äôt know much about them. So I wasn‚Äôt sure what to suggest in the beginning.\nI started asking him a bit about what he had done so far, in what frequency, what type of work and products he was interested in, etc. And bit by bit I came up with ideas that he was interested in. We built on top of them to make sure they fit his style and preferences and got to a solid plan that should push him a bit on a weekly basis. So, here is the plan:\nBrainstorm on ideas you want to build in CAD\nApply every day for a job offer\nDesign each week something in CAD and send it to me (holding him accountable)\nAlternatively: Research on companies‚Äô fabrication processes and find ways to better them\nI was super proud of having come up with a plan that he seemed to be energized about.\nHe also thanked me a lot for it afterwards, which felt super nice! I am super happy about it. I loved doing it and it energized me a lot!\nThen when I got home we didn‚Äôt do much more. Mat cleaned and reorganized a bit the apartment - very nice changes, we had a light dinner and then it was already over.

Well, never say never, but \nofficially\n I am done with the DC/PC/PM role and fully in the \nAutomation Solutions Engineer\n Job! I handed everything over, even the Newsletter workflow to Mathilde. Yes, there are still a few bits of pieces that I have to take care of in the coming days, but nothing major. The good thing is I‚Äôm still in the company so nobody has to come up with solutions to things I forgot to explain, they can just ask and reach out. I also finished the Dell Central report in a record time (1h) not bad for a last day!\nAfter work, I had a little breakdown, because Mat, as so often, demanded something to be done that wasn‚Äôt possible for me to do - Have lunch done by the time she came home. But that was just not possible, because I was working, I finished late and left it then after 6 min, because I wanted to have it done for her in time. I had to also take out the dog and feed her. Then she came home and the only things said were ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs why I told you to do it earlier‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm sorry, not everybody can be bored all day.\nNow that I have raged out my anger, let‚Äôs be honest. I probably overreacted as always and wanted to say yes to something that I knew I couldn‚Äôt do. I probably also took it way to personal, where apparently she didn‚Äôt even see it as such a big deal, that it wasn‚Äôt done. This is for sure something I will have to get a grip on one day.\nThe afternoon I have spent so far with updating my Quests and templates in Notion. Honestly it is becoming a huge system, but I think a super super cool one that could hold an amazing opportunity for the future. I think I‚Äôm up to something here.\nI didn‚Äôt go climbing because it was supposed to rain a lot. And honestly I just also wanted to get shit done while Mat was off in her riding classes.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI have updated my notion workspace\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1cacbfc5-adbc-8075-bd3e-cac69402a08b", "title": "Thursday - April 3, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nCreate the side quests\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nKeep watching the AI content\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was an intense day, yes again!\nOf course this is due to me having a lot of meetings again, but I‚Äôm super happy, because I have now handed over everything, which is insane. I‚Äôm so excited to start on Monday finally!\nToday I had an introduction meeting with Lukas, where he showed me a bit the structure they have in the data team and the tools they use. It was quite nice to have an overview of who is involved in what and what they do within the team. He also showed me how the CRM is done and set up, which is super crazy. It is an insane mess and I now completely understand why we can‚Äôt do some things when we send the requests. I think it would be actually good for the whole company to see this just to understand why we sometimes get rejected by data, when asking for things.\nI also finished the thing for Reb, which towards the end, was a bit annoying. This is because the prompt was just not well enough tuned. I tweaked it a couple of times until it then finally (I think) worked.\nIt is still super cool to think about what it actually enabled for us, because this has saved us hours and hours of manual updating and brain power.\nToday I‚Äôll watch a bit more about AI and finish hopefully to set up the Quests I‚Äôm still missing in Notion.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI handed everything over!\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1c9cbfc5-adbc-80b7-ab17-e54d6d801c44", "title": "Wednesday - April 2, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nAdd Main Quests to the Q\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nUpdate budget tracker formulas\n**Journaling Time**:\nToday was again super intense. But it just makes fun, because I see the super bright shining light at the end of the tunnel, reveling the new adventure lying ahead of me starting from next Monday!! Yes you heard right, next Monday it is - Gina confirmed it with Aoife.\nI can‚Äôt wait honestly. Every step I have taken today was to push through to get closer to this goal of moving completely to the other team. Tomorrow I think will be the hardest day, since Lukas wants 2h from me, Laura as well and then we still have probably 30 min for Bea and finish the thing for Reb. So there is a lot to do for sure, but I‚Äôm just thinking about the end goal. I will make it work! Today I got a bit closer to finishing Reb‚Äôs thing as well. It now read through all the existing comments and got me a list of all interview questions according to what it found in the lead comment. This I can now use to update the questions as they are right now, to choose the best option between the already filled value and the found one by the AI. That way I end up with a clean and certain outcome of what questions where answered and how. Then if after all that they are still blank I can just choose the minimum possible answer for each and then the last step would only be to let it rewrite all lead comment with these updated interview questions. The very last step would be a quick run through all lead comments to make sure they all sound nice and have no mistakes or unwanted info about HP.\nI‚Äôm so happy about all this progress. It has been so easy actually to do once you get the hang out of it. And it‚Äôs not even a proper AI agent. It‚Äôs just an AI with well crafted prompts. Imagine what more I could do once I give them access to things, capability to use functions and other tools, etc. Only the sky is the limit!!\nAfter work I used my time to learn a bit more about AI Agents with Tech With Tim. Very nice showcase that makes it also look super easy and manageable. Let‚Äôs see when we get started on this.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nI got confirmation that I will be starting next Monday\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}, {"id": "1c8cbfc5-adbc-804c-a3de-cc22c6b6c175", "title": "Tuesday - April 1, 2025", "notes": "**Primary Task**:\nAdd Q Template\n**Secondary Task**:\nDo only when primary task is completed\nStart using voicepal\n**Journaling Time**:\nWow, today I really don‚Äôt know what to say. Honestly this whole getting promoted has brought so many more things with it than I thought. I have had so much support from everybody and so many nice words and congrats and excitement from all the ones I expected it and from so many more that I just hadn‚Äôt thought they would actually take the time to give me a warm felt speech.\nThere have been so many exciting moments so far that I am just constantly in a state of excitement. I know this will go down soon bit by bit, but it is super nice to feel that after having worked so so hard! Today we had the Townhall and Aoife told me I should definitely not miss this one to be there personally. So, I assumed of course that there would be a little mention about me having moved to that new role. But I really would have never thought he would go on and no about how well I have done, the transition I have made and the great job I have done so far. It was so surreal to be there in that room with a bunch of people from the company, newbies, team members, other colleagues, etc. And they all just started clapping, looking at me and being proud of how far I had come in that time I worked for this company. I was so speechless and so happy I really couldn‚Äôt say anything. Luckily I didn‚Äôt have to haha. I just started smiling and sweating like hell, so of course when the big speech was over I started coming back to myself and let out a shy laugh, which he picked up on. Being Brahim, he couldn‚Äôt let this slip and had to point at me haha. I couldn‚Äôt anymore, so funny and amazing this moment.\nOtherwise the day was very very busy. Not at all bad, but just super busy. I spent the day handing over the first bits and pieces to Bea and Laura. I spent around 4 hours in total speaking to them two. And the worst part is, I only covered like the basic things. I hadn‚Äôt realized how complex even those basic reports and basic delivery are üòÖ\nAnyway, that was the main part of the day.\nAnother nice thing today, was that I have almost finished the thing for Reb. It is super super cool. And it makes me think of how much I will enjoy this new journey. It is such a nice feeling to see things being built out of the blue by your brain power. Like what the hell, this is so cool. I built now like 3 different purposed AI systems that give me different outputs depending on what I want in the moment to be done to the DB. This so far allowed me to scan through lead comments, get me the important info we need in the interview panel for the delivery and then to reverse it to better all lead comments to make them all uniform and well written, with all relevant information. This has been super cool!\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nTOWNHALL! I got so much credit that‚Äôs crazy!\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}]

OK, I have retrieved your journaling entries for April 2025. Here's the entry for April 30, 2025:

**Wednesday - April 30, 2025**

**Primary Task**:
Keep working on the PM Agent
**Secondary Task**:
Do only when primary task is completed
Work on the notion summarizer
**Journaling Time**:
So, today was quite intense - again!
I worked very intensely on the PM Agent the whole morning. Good thing is, I got surprisingly far with it. That far that I would actually say, that the only thing missing is the tools for the last Agent. Though I think it might be better to feed the individual tasks one by one to another tool LLM instead of running all at once. It seems to do it quite well, but on a real project I think I would be too scared to lose control.
Now we have the rest of the day free, which is great! This means I have enough time to do everything I wanted, especially since we have bad weather.
Later on I worked on the PM tool which also is basically done, the only thing missing is to adapt the way it fetches the raw data, as Alberto made me a new table that has more information. This means I spent today stripping down a bit of code thanks to the more efficient table that allows me to call less queries. Nonetheless it was a lot to look into as even stripping back is like adding new code since you have to change the logic again. But very fun and helpful!       
Then I took Mat to her physio, went for a little grocery shopping tour and made the dinner.
Now I‚Äôll try to finish the basic retrieval of the notion pages.
**Highlight of the Day**:
A lot of success on the PM Agent
**Notes / Ideas**:

I hope this is exactly what you were looking for! Let me know if you need anything else.
