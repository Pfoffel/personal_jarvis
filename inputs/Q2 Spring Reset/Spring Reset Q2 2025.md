# Q2 Spring Reset 2025

# Life Assessment

Take a moment to rate your satisfaction with each area of your life on a scale of 1-10 (1 being extremely dissatisfied, 10 being completely satisfied).

| Area | Rating (1-10) | Note(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health & Vitality | 8 | I've been working out more and more routinely as well, feeling the differences now over this period |
| Work & Ambition | 10 | I've completely revolutionized my work and ambition by aiming always for the next level! I have reached things I thought never possible |
| Money & Finances | 6 | It's not the easiest topic for me, but I was trying to implement methods like tracking that have helped in realizing what I can spend and when. Also I've gotten down on my debts which helps as well |
| Relationships & Love | 8 | In general very happy, we have now a little family with our cat and dog and communicate way better as the time passes. There are some caveats right now where I feel like I can only progress there with the help of my partner |
| Family & Friends | 6 | Family was always a struggle as my family is not the best to be around with or to talk to. We don't have a deep connection, but I've tried as well being more persistent with calling them and talking to them. Friends has gone down since when I was younger, but I think now I'm getting it to be better as well, bit by bit, but yeah not too satisfied. |
| Learning & Growth | 9 | Learning and growth I would say I'm super satisfied. I would love to prioritize those things a bit more to learn more as it is a passion for me. But I can't complain  I've leveled up my skills and knowledge like he'll over this Q |
| Adventure & Excitement | 6 | I have stopped having a many adventure as I would actually like to. I am a very excite-ful person and learning new things for example makes me feel super excited. But I think this is not the point. So for sure I think my new goals of reaching calisthenic goals can help. Also I think by going out more on the moto, I think I can regain this sense of adventure. |
| Inner Peace & Spirituality | 4 | I basically need to make myself a bit smarter in this one. I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do here nor what my status is. |

# Action Points

Keep reaching out to family and be more open with them

# Step 1: Reflect on the Last Quarter

## Work

**What's working in my professional life?**

I got a raise and switched to a new job title and a whole other department. I have been working on getting this for the past 3 months. I went full in and managed this almost completely on my own. I took things into my own hands, by telling my boss that I wanted more and that I wanted to be more. She was completely agreeing with me and with the proposal I had made. This was the catalysator that brought everything into motion. And just this week it finally happened I got the confirmation that I will be moving to a higher position in the data team of our company.

---

**What's not working in my professional life?**

I still think this is not meant for me. Yes, I love the people in my company - honestly, just amazing smart people. But I am sure this is just temporary. Everything I want to achieve in life will probably not happen if I keep working for a company. At least not if I work for them only. I have to work on my own things at least for a while until I then have the possibility to choose what I would like to do. But without having the possibility to choose, I think I will never be satisfied with what I am doing right now. A company life is not how I want to spent my life I think. I would love to grow a side hustle to a point where I could make my living out of it.

---

**What were my most energizing work-related activities in Q1 2025?**

I started a website for my side hustle and I have done a lot of automations and learned a lot about AI to help me grow my skills and perform better and take on new challenges. Well and I would say as well getting my first app to actually run without any bugs so far, is quite a big achievement for me!

- Working on the newsletters
- Working on the app
- Working on automations
- Working on the website
- Working with AI

---

**What were my most draining work-related activities in Q1 2025?**

I would say handling all that I have planned at once. I do work quite hard and I do like my work, but with that said I am constantly torn between what to do and how to do it efficiently enough to get all done.

- deliveries
- waiting for QC
- senseless meetings

---

## Life

**What's working in my personal life?**

I have formed a little family, a GF, dog, cat, and I feel this is making me really happy. We are all in sync and working together to have a better life. I am more consistent with working out and I managed to pursue my goals by visualizing them and making deadlines. I am working on bettering the relationship I have with my family even though it‚Äôs super complicated for me. 

---

**What's not working in my personal life?**

I would like more organization, less ‚Äútime wasting‚Äù. We fell into the habit of not taking action on things and just be ‚Äúresting‚Äù all the time since last year or so. I already escaped this a bit by actively working on these type of methods and scheduling and tracking things to get them done, thanks to you, but this is a struggle for my GF. She is a main pillar in my life though, so this makes it difficult sometimes to move things when a pillar is holding you back. I would love to get into a proper routine together and to get her interested into my ambition to learn and do things. But that‚Äôs not something I can force on her. It clicked for me at one point for some reason, so it has to click for her as well. I do think some things are rubbing off on her from what I have implemented, but it is a long road ahead of her/us still. Otherwise I would still like to make more progress in the friends and family section. I want to be closer to my loved ones again or start being it if I never was.

Finally I actually never did anything to improve the spiritual section of the wheel of life, and I‚Äôm falling behind on the adventure and excitement part. 

---

**What were my most energizing personal activities in Q1 2025?**

Organizing my week, achieving my goals, getting a dog. Being consistent, aiming for growth. 

- Working out consistently
- Going for walks with the dog
- Implementing nature into my environment
- Dinners and hangouts
- Cleaning the apartment
- Reading
- Going out on the moto
- Taking photos

---

**What were my most draining personal activities in Q1 2025?**

- Watching too much TV/Series/etc.
- Efficiency in running errands
- shopping
-

# Step 2: Align to your Life Compass

**‚ùì Looking Back:** How closely have my actions over the past few months aligned with my overarching life vision? Consider areas where I‚Äôve excelled and areas where I might be a little misaligned.

Example (feel free to delete): Pretty good broadly. Got married, which was definitely part of the Life Vision. And we‚Äôve just moved to Hong Kong for at least a year, which means we can start making friends, building community etc. Health-wise, might be a little misaligned - whenever I travel, the health takes a nose-dive, and the life vision involves a decent amount of travelling. But also, life‚Äôs been quite chaotic recently, would be nice to get back into the rhythm of things.

- Make a proper compass later

> Answer: Pretty good! I have taken my destiny into my own hands. I am immensely proud of myself, about what I have reached this Q. I have hit the goals I have set and I have learned so many new things. I feel like I am finally taking advantage of the intelligence everybody always told me that I had. I have made my first steps into a side hustle which is one big thing I want to get rolling. Then I have taken action in being more active again, where the dog helped a lot as well. On the other hand I am still struggling to say no to things that I don‚Äôt want to do just because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint anyone. I have to be stronger in my opinion and more resilient to what I want to do and make.

**üìù Looking Ahead:** What specific actions could I take in the next 90 days to get more aligned with my life vision?

I would like to make more of a habit to be in touch with friends and family. Be more open with them and tell them more about me and my life, but also ask them more about theirs. I feel like I know nothing about my close ones.

Then I would like to get rid of distractions more permanently. I don‚Äôt want to spend as much time consuming media, I prefer rather make the media myself.

So actions I can take:

- Schedule calls or messages with loved ones
- Set fix times or fixed amount of time for when and for how long I can watch media and justify why I watched it
- Document the progress and changes
- Go on spontaneous trips to discover something
- Join local get togethers to get to know more people like you

# Step 3: Define your Quarterly Quests

## Your Work Main Quest

**If I could only make meaningful progress on ONE work-related thing in Q2, what would most positively impact my professional life?**

Consider:

- What's the ONE thing that, if accomplished, would move the needle the absolute most?
- If you fast-forward 3 months, what's the one accomplishment that would make you say "this quarter was a success"?
- What's the one achievement that would make everything else easier or unnecessary?
- If I spent the first 2 hours of my work day purely focused on X, it would have an enormous impact.

**My Work Main Quest is to:**

Understand and build AI Agents

---

**This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because:**

The CEO of my company is counting on me to give input to this topic to push his business to where he wants it to be. Additionally I think this makes sense for me to understand for all sorts of different challenges and quests I want to tackle. App building, blog writing, newsletters, and future proof in general - this is a huge deal to understand this and to know how to use it.

---

**I make a commitment to myself that by June 30, 2025, I'll have:**

- taken 50 courses/webinars/articles/etc. about AI agents
- put into practice the things I learned in them to actually make use of it.

---

**This feels really exciting and compelling for me because:**

I have always been playing with AI and had a fascination for it. So I think this will enable me to know more about it and therefore make me an expert in this very important topic for the coming future world

---

**To make sure I complete the Quest, I‚Äôm going to:**

- Spend 5h a week on learning about AI and their capabilities.
- code something 5 times a week
- Build one simple agent per month

---

## Your Life Main Quest

**If I could only make meaningful progress on ONE personal thing in Q2, what would most positively impact my life?**

Consider:

- What would make you feel more fulfilled and balanced in your personal life?
- What habit or practice would have the biggest positive impact on your wellbeing?
- What relationship or personal growth area needs the most attention?
- What would make you proud of yourself beyond work achievements?

**My Life Main Quest is to:**

Pick up calisthenics again!

---

**This is the single most important thing for me to accomplish this quarter because:**

I loved the person I was when I trained this back in the days. I felt super strong, had amazing abilities, I could do so many cool things and I just felt super energized every time when I learned something new. I would like to be that person again!

---

**I make a commitment to myself that by June 30, 2025, I'll have:**

- 1.5 min handstand
- 10 solo handstand pushups
- solid straddle planch

---

**This feels really exciting and compelling for me because:**

I know I can do this, because I already did it. I think this is an amazing push for mental and physical health if done right.

---

**To make sure I complete the Quest, I‚Äôm going to:**

- trained for 3h a week
- record my progress to see how I progress over time
- stretch properly before each workout for 15 min
- Do strong forearm and wrist training

---

# Side Quests:

What are some Work Side Quests you might like to work towards this quarter?

- Get the MVP of the App into the Play Store
- Work on the website consistently, meaning:
    - 1 newsletter every month
    - 1 post every 2 weeks at least

What are some Work Side Quests you might like to work towards this quarter?

- Consume less content
- Go on more date/friends dinners
- Take the moto to discover the area
- Pay all my depts

# Step 4: Create your Action Plan

## Work

**What specific steps can I take to make progress on my Work Main Quest?**

- Skillshare in month 2 of the Q?
- Brainstorm on ideas for AI agents that you could use and build
- While watching the tutorials write down notes
- Share my progress with team members
- Read articles and blog posts as this is something you should do more in general

---

**What do I need to delete or deprioritize to make space for this focus?**

- Watching content that has nothing to do with this
- Wake up consistently at 7:00

---

**Where am I allowing perfection to be the enemy of progress in my work?**

When getting started I still think I have to know more to test the principles I learned. Recently I had to test the principles though and this forced me to actually action things. Everything worked without major inconveniences. So I should stop thinking and start acting

---

**What daily or weekly systems could I implement to ensure consistent action?**

- A notion board gathering all content watched
- What I have learned from it
- hat action steps I can take to use what I have learned
- Add a follow up section where I have to attach the project I have completed to each content watched.

---

## Life

**What specific steps can I take to make progress on my Life Main Quest?**

- Write down a routine that I have to follow for building strength in my shoulder and wrists
- Write down the initial values for where I stand now
- Keep updating those values over the course of the Q to see and monitor progress
- Record my journey to see the transformation

---

**What do I need to delete or deprioritize to make space for this focus?**

- Communicate your goal and the importance of it for Mat to understand that I have to workout for this to work

---

**Where am I allowing perfection to be the enemy of progress in my personal life?**

I always want to perform the way I did when I was doing this 4h a day. I am demotivated when I realize that I have lost those abilities and that I will have to start from scratch to build up strength before I go back to pushing for results.
