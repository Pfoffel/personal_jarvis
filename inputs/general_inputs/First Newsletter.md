# "The Journey" - Issue #1

## 1. Welcome & Introduction

Hello and welcome to "The Journey"! I'm thrilled to share with you my first personal newsletter ever. As someone deeply passionate about AI, automation, and personal growth, I've created this monthly newsletter to share insights into my development journey, ideas, challenges, and discoveries in these fields.

The main purpose is to create an open space with people who share these interests or are simply curious about my professional and personal development path. By following "The Journey," you get to be part of this development and can reach out directly by replying to this email. I believe in collaborationâ€”brainstorming and tackling problems together rather than individually. After all, together we are stronger!

Each newsletter will follow this structure (until I change my mind ðŸ˜†):

1. **This Month in Review**: Key events, wins, challenges, and behind-the-scenes content
2. **Lessons & Insights**: My "Aha Moments" and helpful tools I've discovered
3. **Looking Ahead**: A sneak peek at upcoming projects and next month's goals
4. **Community Corner**: Your space to reflect on what you've read, with a personal challenge from me

So without further ado, enjoy the first edition of "The Journey"!

## 2. This Month in Review

### Key Events

- **Transition to Automation Solutions Engineer:** On Wednesday, April 2, 2025, I received confirmation of my new role! Earlier this year, I took the initiative to speak with my boss about my desires to work more with automations, software development, process improvements, and implementing AI to drive productivity. She was completely supportive! This taught me the value of being open about your goalsâ€”people can only help you if they know what you want. The support I received during this transition was truly energizing.

- **AI Game Agent Presentation:** One of my first projects in the new role was creating an AI Agent that could showcase the power of AI implementation. We decided on recreating the Snake Game. Despite initial impostor syndrome, I embraced the challenge and chose the most complex framework. To my surprise, it was both manageable and enjoyable. My bosses were impressed with the final presentation, cementing my confidence in this new position!

- **Power Outage Experience:** On Monday, April 28, 2025, at 12:33, a massive power outage affected all of Spain and other European regions. Working from home that day, I suddenly lost all power, internet, and cell reception. This eye-opening experience highlighted our dependence on electricity and connectivity. With no digital distractions, I spent the workday manually reviewing code on paper, which actually provided a fresh perspective. Later, Mat and I played "Stadt, Land, Fluss" (a German word game we both enjoy)â€”sometimes analog experiences provide the perfect break!

### Wins to Celebrate

- **PM Tool Web App:** Made significant progress connecting the database and implementing key features.
- **Personal AI Assistant:** Implemented a private AI with access to internet resources and my journal entriesâ€”the beginnings of my personal Jarvis!
- **Implementing New Habits:** Created a 15-minute stretch routine and wrist/forearm training program to help with my shoulder recovery and calisthenics goals.

### Challenges & Setbacks

- **Keeping up Habits:** Despite automation and reminders, some days I struggle to maintain my routines, even when they take just 5 minutes.
- **AI Coding:** While exciting, working with cutting-edge AI presents challengesâ€”there are few established best practices, requiring patience and experimentation, which tests my tendency to want immediate results.

### Behind the Scenes

For my quarterly goals (ending June), I'm working on several projects:

My personal AI assistant was built using Python libraries: Langchain, Langgraph, and Pydantic. This allowed me to implement custom tools within an hour that the AI can access when responding to my promptsâ€”an exciting side quest!

To reach my quarterly goals efficiently, I'm tracking these habits in TickTick:
- Reading: 2 times weekly
- Journaling: Daily
- Stretching: 4 times weekly
- Updating goal trackers: Sundays
- Updating budget tracker: Sundays
- Website work: Sundays

I've been consistent with most habits, though stretching remains challenging.

## 3. Lessons & Insights

### What I Learned

- **AI and Automation:** Deepened my understanding of AI implementation and automation workflows.
- **Tool Creation:** Learned how to create proper tools and agents with well-defined inputs/outputs.
- **Importance of Communication:** Discovered that open, honest communication is the fastest way to progressâ€”in both personal and professional relationships.

### "Aha!" Moment

- **Power Outage Revelation:** The blackout made me realize not only our technological dependence but also how stepping away from technology can provide clarity and new perspectives on complex problems.

### Resource Corner

- **TickTick:** A powerful task management app for tracking progress and setting reminders.
- **NotebookLM:** A promising AI tool from Google that transforms how we learn and study. More details in next month's newsletter after I've explored it further.

## 4. Looking Ahead

### Next Month's Goals

- **Server Planning:** Research options for hosting my personal apps, AI tools, and creating my own private cloud.
- **AI Projects:** Continue exploring and building with AI, including testing NotebookLM and developing my own tools.
- **DailyBites:** Fix bugs and improve the UI of my first mobile app before launching it on the Play Store.

### One Big Question

- How can we use AI to create more meaningful and fulfilling lives rather than just more efficient ones?
- How do we balance technological dependence with human connection?

### Personal Challenge for You!

- **Learn Something NEW:** Choose a topic you find interesting but know little about and spend 15 minutes learning about it. I'm currently fascinated by how electricity distribution worksâ€”the recent outage sparked my curiosity about how power actually reaches our homes.
