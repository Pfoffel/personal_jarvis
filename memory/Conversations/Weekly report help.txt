Okay, from our last conversation, I remember that:

*   You were considering a multi-agent system for me, with specialized agents for different domains like finance and travel.
*   We discussed that a hybrid approach might be the most effective, with a general-purpose agent delegating tasks to specialized agents as needed.
*   You had saved a report on the topic for future reference.

Also, I have some general information about you:

*   Your name is Henoch. You are curious, happy, and love to learn and improve yourself.
*   Your Q2 goals are focused on learning AI through projects, regaining calisthenics skills, and side quests like website updates, launching a diet journal app, motorcycle trips, and relationship building.
*   You live in Madrid, your girlfriend is Mathilde (Mat), and you have two pets: a cat named Rio and a dog named Roma.

Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss further? Perhaps you'd like to revisit the multi-agent system idea or discuss your Q2 goals?
You: So you also helped me come up with a file that serves as an instruction manual called jarvis weekly reflection Manual. Can you read it to you so you get the context? th
en I you also asked me to provide you with additional conotent like the following: 1.  **Notion Journaling Structure:** Can you describe the structure of your Notion journaling entries? Specifically, how are the "Primary Tasks," "Secondary Tasks," "Journal," and "Notes/Ideas" sections organized within each entry? This will help me accurately extract the relevant information.2.  **Date Format:** What is the format of the date in your Notion journal entries? (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)3.  **Q2 Goals Context:** To provide the most relevant feedback on your progress toward your Q2 goals, I need to have a clear understanding of what those goals are. You've already provided some information, but are there any specific metrics or milestones you're tracking for each goal? whic I answered like this: Ok for now i will give you an answer for the first 2 questions. the third one is a bit longer to answer so I will get you a tool to make it easier for you to understand. Please find the answers for the first 2 here: 1: Primary task and secondary task. You will always find a mention of a primary task, that will be the most needle moving task each day that will help me make significant improvement t
owards one of my goals. The secondary task is usually a more generic one that just helps me alongside the main quests. could be something like clean the apartment since this would help me have a calm mind with due to a cleaner environment. Then the journal section is where I leave everything I have done that day. Actual events, thoughts, feelings, doubts, things Im proud of, ideas, anything. Then the ideas section usually is empty because i already put ideas in the journalinng setion. I just use it when there is a big idea i already want to start working on.

## Instruction Manual: Weekly Reflection with Jarvis

**Objective:** To provide a structured and insightful weekly reflection process, leveraging Jarvis's capabilities to analyze Notion journal entries and offer personalized feedback.

**Frequency:** Weekly (ideally on Sunday evening or Monday morning)

**Steps:**

1.  **Initiate the Reflection Process:**
    *   The user will initiate the weekly reflection by stating that they are ready to begin.

2.  **Retrieve Notion Journal Entries:**
    *   Jarvis will use the `get_date` tool to determine the current date.
    *   Jarvis will calculate the start and end dates for the previous week (Monday to Sunday).
    *   For each day of the previous week, Jarvis will:
        *   Use the `get_notion_journaling_day` tool to retrieve the Notion journal entry for that day, using the date format "Weekday - Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Sunday - May 12, 2024").
        *   If no entry exists for a particular day, Jarvis will note that in the report.
    *   Jarvis will compile all retrieved journal entries into a single document for analysis.

3.  **Analyze Journal Entries and Answer Reflection Questions:**
    *   Jarvis will analyze the compiled journal entries, focusing on identifying key events, accomplishments, challenges, and insights, paying particular attention to the "Primary Task," "Secondary Task," and "Journal" sections.
    *   Based on the analysis, Jarvis will answer the following three questions:
        *   **What went right this week?** (Identify successes, positive outcomes, and moments of progress, especially related to the "Primary Tasks.")
        *   **What went wrong this week?** (Identify challenges, setbacks, and areas where improvement is needed, considering both "Primary" and "Secondary Tasks.")
        *   **What can I improve next week to make it work better?** (Suggest specific actions, strategies, or adjustments to address the identified challenges and enhance future performance, focusing on optimizing "Primary Tasks" for goal achievement.)

4.  **Provide Personalized Feedback:**
    *   In addition to answering the reflection questions, Jarvis will provide the following personalized feedback:
        *   **Summary of Reflections:** A concise overview of the week's key events, accomplishments, and challenges.
        *   **Recurring Themes:** Identification of any recurring patterns or trends in the user's successes and challenges.
        *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** Specific and actionable recommendations for addressing the identified challenges and enhancing future performance.
        *   **Progress Tracking:** Assessment of the user's progress toward their Q2 goals, highlighting any significant achievements or areas where further effort is needed.
        *   **Alignment with Q2 Goals:** Evaluation of how well the week's activities contributed to the user's main quests and side quests, with suggestions for improving alignment in the future. Special attention will be given to how the "Primary Tasks" align with the user's goals.

5.  **Save the Detailed Report:**
    *   Jarvis will save the detailed report, including the answers to the reflection questions and the personalized feedback, as a markdown file.
    *   The file name will follow the format: `Weekly_Reflection_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (where YYYY-MM-DD is the Sunday date of the week being reflected upon).
    *   Jarvis will save the file in the `writing` directory.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Privacy:** Jarvis will handle the user's journal entries with the utmost confidentiality and will only use them for the purpose of generating the weekly reflection report.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** This instruction manual is a living document and can be updated and refined based on the user's feedback and evolving needs.

Okay, I've reviewed the "Jarvis\_Weekly\_Reflection\_Manual.md" file. I now have a much clearer understanding of the weekly reflection process you'd like me to follow.      

To summarize, the process involves:

1.  **Initiation:** You'll let me know when you're ready to begin the weekly reflection.
2.  **Data Retrieval:** I'll retrieve your Notion journal entries for the previous week (Monday to Sunday) using the `get_notion_journaling_day` tool.
3.  **Analysis:** I'll analyze the entries, focusing on the "Primary Task," "Secondary Task," and "Journal" sections to identify key events, accomplishments, challenges, and insights.
4.  **Reflection Questions:** I'll answer the following questions:
    *   What went right this week?
    *   What went wrong this week?
    *   What can I improve next week to make it work better?
5.  **Personalized Feedback:** I'll provide:
    *   A summary of reflections.
    *   Identification of recurring themes.
    *   Suggestions for improvement.
    *   Progress tracking toward your Q2 goals.
    *   Evaluation of alignment with your Q2 goals.
6.  **Report Saving:** I'll save the report as a markdown file named `Weekly_Reflection_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the `writing` directory.

Now that I have this context, I'm ready to assist you with your weekly reflections whenever you'd like. Just let me know when you're ready to start!

After the long weekend it was especially hard to be honest. But as usual very entertaining and very fun!\nI finished implementing everything for the PM Tool and even started moving it to Irina, more to it later on. The big achievement today was most definitely having had my first two full example runs with the PM Agent. First was the snake game with different settings than the usual game and it worked. Not just that, it also took all the questions it answered me and implemented them correctly! So cool! I also tried it on a web scraper script, which also directly worked. I think this one is very easy though! Afterwards I had a call with Lukas (my direct boss), he was really happy and excited to hear these news. He didn’t think we would make such good progress - I didn’t even imagine it would work. I am super proud that I got it to work to this point. He asked me then to ask it something more complex, like creating a full address book, with its usual features and all that. It is not a full CRM, but it already proofs something similar. I was sure this one would be more complex, as it needed to safe several files now instead of just one. So there was definitely the issue I ran into. It gave me a proper output I think, but it wasn’t able to save everything. I will try tomorrow to run the code it printed in the console, since it wasn’t able to actually save it in files. If this works, I am honestly super impressed!\nThen it was already all of the sudden around 16h. It was crazy how fast the day had passed. I asked Ruben to help me implement my webapp for the PM tool into our server (Irina). I have never done something like that, so I had no idea how that worked. In general it is fairly simple, but as usual putting things into a new environment messed up the whole app. It didn’t work at all. Some things I understood, because they were obvious things like relative paths not working, because they were now somewhere else etc. But the weirdest things were those like variables that were initialized correctly that randomly just didn’t work etc. Super weird, no clue what the issue was. Luckily Ruben, nice as he is, he stayed 40 min after work to fix all those issues and make it run! What a nice guys and what a freak. This is definitely a nice team to have!\nAfter that I didn’t do much - I was super tired today. I updated the trackers for all the quests and was happy to see that I could check quite some tasks off of them. Unfortunately there were also some that hadn’t moved at all in the past month. So, for this month it’s a clear priority to get the Daily Bites production running again. I will see this week what the best next steps to take are to ensure I focus on the important ones first. Still, all together it was nice to update, as I realized I’m quite advanced.\nThat’s basically it, otherwise, I am only missing to check for a better prompt for my Jarvis and that would be it.\nI also had an idea to make this whole Notion AI an available thing, as I think there are not really any done solutions to handling Notion automatically let alone through AI. Maybe their own AI, but still not as capable as what I intend to do with it. So, let’s see if I can do a full project out of it and maybe feature it on my website.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nFirst results with the PM Agent\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}]

Yet another amazing day!\nToday we started with another great breakfast, and then straight into moving our feet. We went again to dance classes. It was really really fun. Today we danced a lot and we got to dance the way we wanted which was super complicated. You think having the control about where your partner goes is easy and would make things easy. But it is just so complicated to think about which steps to take next and in a way to feel like you have to entertain the other to make it enjoyable. So it was for sure a stressful experience as well. There were two really good dancers there, which surely have a lot of practice already. Seeing them dance together was crazy because it looks like they came prepared with something in mind to dance. Super crazy how for once the guy makes the sequence up in his mind as they go and the woman just follows him without thinking at all. Amazing!\nThen I wanted to go out have lunch with Mat to just spent some time together without distractions and on one side celebrating that I got my raise and on the other also as a little apology for yesterday. She definitely enjoyed it a lot, me as well! It was great!\nThen I spent some time refining the blog post (the 4th one already, soo cool!) and published it already. It turned out quite good I would say. It could help a bunch of people for sure! I really hope bit by bit people will start seeing them and actually benefit from them. It would be so cool to receive a first comment or a first contact request to just connect and talk about stuff. I have to work a lot on it though. I have to really make it a full experience and make people see me for the good things I could do. And I have to show them a clear value with a page that defines services I could provide other people with. The first day I’ll get a request there will definitely be a huge breakthrough. Today I found some new tricks to get more customized value into the posts. I asked Gemini to give me picture ideas for the sections in my post that it thought could benefit from one. Usually it gives me just that, descriptions of the pictures I could look for and then implement. This time though it went a step further, probably it got updated or something, it gave me a generated picture for those sections that were incredibly well made and realistic. They looked like well taken photos on a good camera. And no real limit was visible which is already so much better than chat gpt that makes you reach the daily limit instantly. I really love Gemini more and more. I’m really thinking about taking the advanced subscription. Then for the other sections that I have to still create on my website, the more in depth about me section or the gallery section and the skills section, all those are still not there. I asked claude to give me a draft and as always it was instantly such a good draft that I could take and build upon. I love the age we live in!\nFinally we didn’t do much more after that, we reserved the car we will rent for our trip to Madeira and then basically went to bed. We finished the series we were watching: The Glass Dome, which is a Swedish series about a guy that kidnaps little girls to feel closer to his mother or something like that. The plot twist was crazy, nobody thought this would turn out that way. Anyway that was basically the day.\nNow I will still finish to update the weekly tracker with Jarvis and then see if I can draft some other sections of the website with Claude.\n**Highlight of the Day**:\nCool dance session with Mat\n**Notes / Ideas**:\n "}]

Of course! Here's a summary of each day from last week, based on your Notion journal entries:

*   **Monday, May 5th, 2025:** You finished the full agent workflow for the PM Agent and achieved successful example runs. You also started moving it to Irina. You were super proud of the progress. You also updated the trackers for all the quests.
*   **Tuesday, May 6th, 2025:** You implemented all subsequent agents into the main supervisor for the PM Agent and added a tool to allow it to create the full project folder. You also added Langsmith to trace the calls. You implemented new tools for Jarvis: one to get a list of files, another to read the content of a file, and a tool to open files.
*   **Wednesday, May 7th, 2025:** You had a meeting where you shared the progress on the PM Agent. You also had a meeting with Aoife presenting your first finished version of the project you were doing for the PM Team. You fixed inconsistency issues on both projects thanks to Langsmith.
*   **Thursday, May 8th, 2025:** You added a scratchpad to the PM Agent and tried the vector base for Jarvis. You also worked on the online webapp making it accessible through the server. You confirmed the vector db works for Jarvis.
*   **Friday, May 9th, 2025:** You tested the scratchpad functionality for the PM Agent. You managed to ensure that all basic functions work as intended for the PM tool webapp and that there are different sessions for each user. You had a BBQ and told the DCs and Aoife about Jarvis. You had a conversation with Mat about her job situation.      
*   **Saturday, May 10th, 2025:** You planned the next steps on Daily Bites and drafted the next post. You also researched what a good CV for a PA role should look like for Mat. You had a communication breakdown with Mat.
*   **Sunday, May 11th, 2025:** You published another blog post. You went to dance classes with Mat. You refined the blog post and found new tricks to get more customized value into the posts using Gemini.

I hope this is helpful! Have a good night, and sleep well! I'll be here when you need me.

================================== Ai Message ==================================
Name: Jarvis

Okay, I've added the step to include a summary of each weekday at the beginning of the report to the "Jarvis Weekly Reflection Manual." Here's the updated manual:

## Instruction Manual: Weekly Reflection with Jarvis

**Objective:** To provide a structured and insightful weekly reflection process, leveraging Jarvis's capabilities to analyze Notion journal entries and offer personalized feedback.

**Frequency:** Weekly (ideally on Sunday evening or Monday morning)

**Steps:**

1.  **Initiate the Reflection Process:**
    *   The user will initiate the weekly reflection by stating that they are ready to begin.

2.  **Retrieve Notion Journal Entries:**
    *   Jarvis will use the `get_date` tool to determine the current date.
    *   Jarvis will calculate the start and end dates for the previous week (Monday to Sunday).
    *   For each day of the previous week, Jarvis will:
        *   Use the `get_notion_journaling_day` tool to retrieve the Notion journal entry for that day, using the date format "Weekday - Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Sunday - May 12, 2024").
        *   If no entry exists for a particular day, Jarvis will note that in the report.
    *   Jarvis will compile all retrieved journal entries into a single document for analysis.

3.  **Create a Summary of Each Weekday:**
    *   Jarvis will create a concise summary of the key events, accomplishments, and challenges for each day of the week, based on the retrieved Notion journal entries.     
    *   This summary will be included at the beginning of the weekly reflection report.

4.  **Analyze Journal Entries and Answer Reflection Questions:**
    *   Jarvis will analyze the compiled journal entries, focusing on identifying key events, accomplishments, challenges, and insights, paying particular attention to the "Primary Task," "Secondary Task," and "Journal" sections.
    *   Based on the analysis, Jarvis will answer the following three questions:
        *   **What went right this week?** (Identify successes, positive outcomes, and moments of progress, especially related to the "Primary Tasks.")
        *   **What went wrong this week?** (Identify challenges, setbacks, and areas where improvement is needed, considering both "Primary" and "Secondary Tasks.")
        *   **What can I improve next week to make it work better?** (Suggest specific actions, strategies, or adjustments to address the identified challenges and enhance future performance, focusing on optimizing "Primary Tasks" for goal achievement.)

5.  **Provide Personalized Feedback:**
    *   In addition to answering the reflection questions, Jarvis will provide the following personalized feedback:
        *   **Summary of Reflections:** A concise overview of the week's key events, accomplishments, and challenges.
        *   **Recurring Themes:** Identification of any recurring patterns or trends in the user's successes and challenges.
        *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** Specific and actionable recommendations for addressing the identified challenges and enhancing future performance.
        *   **Progress Tracking:** Assessment of the user's progress toward their Q2 goals, highlighting any significant achievements or areas where further effort is needed.
        *   **Alignment with Q2 Goals:** Evaluation of how well the week's activities contributed to the user's main quests and side quests, with suggestions for improving alignment in the future. Special attention will be given to how the "Primary Tasks" align with the user's goals.

6.  **Save the Detailed Report:**
    *   Jarvis will save the detailed report, including the weekday summaries, the answers to the reflection questions, and the personalized feedback, as a markdown file.   
    *   The file name will follow the format: `Weekly_Reflection_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (where YYYY-MM-DD is the Sunday date of the week being reflected upon).
    *   Jarvis will save the file in the `writing` directory.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Privacy:** Jarvis will handle the user's journal entries with the utmost confidentiality and will only use them for the purpose of generating the weekly reflection report.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** This instruction manual is a living document and can be updated and refined based on the user's feedback and evolving needs.

I will now update the report you already finished with the weekday summaries:

    *   Jarvis will create a brief summary of the key activities and events for each day of the week, based on the retrieved Notion journal entries.
    *   These summaries will be included at the beginning of the weekly reflection report.

4.  **Analyze Journal Entries and Answer Reflection Questions:**
    *   Jarvis will analyze the compiled journal entries, focusing on identifying key events, accomplishments, challenges, and insights, paying particular attention to the "Primary Task," "Secondary Task," and "Journal" sections.
    *   Based on the analysis, Jarvis will answer the following three questions:
        *   **What went right this week?** (Identify successes, positive outcomes, and moments of progress, especially related to the "Primary Tasks.")
        *   **What went wrong this week?** (Identify challenges, setbacks, and areas where improvement is needed, considering both "Primary" and "Secondary Tasks.")
        *   **What can I improve next week to make it work better?** (Suggest specific actions, strategies, or adjustments to address the identified challenges and enhance future performance, focusing on optimizing "Primary Tasks" for goal achievement.)

5.  **Provide Personalized Feedback:**
    *   In addition to answering the reflection questions, Jarvis will provide the following personalized feedback:
        *   **Summary of Reflections:** A concise overview of the week's key events, accomplishments, and challenges.
        *   **Recurring Themes:** Identification of any recurring patterns or trends in the user's successes and challenges.
        *   **Suggestions for Improvement:** Specific and actionable recommendations for addressing the identified challenges and enhancing future performance.
        *   **Progress Tracking:** Assessment of the user's progress toward their Q2 goals, highlighting any significant achievements or areas where further effort is needed.
        *   **Alignment with Q2 Goals:** Evaluation of how well the week's activities contributed to the user's main quests and side quests, with suggestions for improving alignment in the future. Special attention will be given to how the "Primary Tasks" align with the user's goals.

6.  **Save the Detailed Report:**
    *   Jarvis will save the detailed report, including the weekday summaries, the answers to the reflection questions, and the personalized feedback, as a markdown file.   
    *   The file name will follow the format: `Weekly_Reflection_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (where YYYY-MM-DD is the Sunday date of the week being reflected upon).
    *   Jarvis will save the file in the `writing` directory.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Privacy:** Jarvis will handle the user's journal entries with the utmost confidentiality and will only use them for the purpose of generating the weekly reflection report.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** This instruction manual is a living document and can be updated and refined based on the user's feedback and evolving needs.

    content: ## Instruction Manual: Weekly Reflection with Jarvis

**Objective:** To provide a structured and insightful weekly reflection process, leveraging Jarvis's capabilities to analyze Notion journal entries and offer personalized feedback.

**Frequency:** Weekly (ideally on Sunday evening or Monday morning)

**Steps:**

1.  **Initiate the Reflection Process:**
    *   The user will initiate the weekly reflection by stating that they are ready to begin.

2.  **Retrieve Notion Journal Entries:**
    *   Jarvis will use the `get_date` tool to determine the current date.
    *   Jarvis will calculate the start and end dates for the previous week (Monday to Sunday).
    *   For each day of the previous week, Jarvis will:
        *   Use the `get_notion_journaling_day` tool to retrieve the Notion journal entry for that day, using the date format "Weekday - Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Sunday - May 12, 2024").
        *   If no entry exists for a particular day, Jarvis will note that in the report.
    *   Jarvis will compile all retrieved journal entries into a single document for analysis.

3.  **Summarize Daily Activities:**
    *   Jarvis will create a brief summary of the key activities and events for each day of the week, based on the retrieved Notion journal entries.
    *   These summaries will be included at the beginning of the weekly reflection report.

4.  **Analyze Journal Entries and Answer Reflection Questions:**
    *   Jarvis will analyze the compiled journal entries, focusing on identifying key events, accomplishments, challenges, and insights, paying particular attention to the "Primary Task," "Secondary Task," and "Journal" sections.
